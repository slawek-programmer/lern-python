Creating variables:

```python
>>> a = 1  # creating a new variable a and assigning 1
>>> b = 2  # creating a new variable b and assigning 2
>>> b  #  taking values from variable b
2
```

Adding variables

```python
>>> c = a + b # creating a new variable and adding to it the value from the result of adding a and b
>>> c #  taking values from variable c
3
```
